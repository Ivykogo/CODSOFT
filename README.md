# CODSOFT INTERNSHIP PROJECTS  

This repository showcases the projects I completed during my internship at CodSoft. This opportunity allowed me to enhance my skills in **Data Science** and gain hands-on experience in various areas, including:  

- Data Cleaning  
- Data Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Engineering  
- Data Visualization  
- Machine Learning Modeling  
- Algorithm Implementation  
- Model Evaluation & Optimization  

## Projects  

###  [Movie Rating Prediction](https://github.com/Ivykogo/Movie-rating-prediction-with-python)  
Developed a predictive model to estimate movie ratings using machine learning techniques in Python. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.  

###  [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/Ivykogo/Credit-card-fraud-detection)  
Built a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Applied various classification algorithms and evaluated their performance to improve accuracy.  

###  [Sales Prediction using Linear Regression](https://github.com/Ivykogo/Sales-prediction-Linear-regression)  
Implemented a linear regression model to forecast sales based on historical data. The project focused on feature selection, model training, and performance optimization.
